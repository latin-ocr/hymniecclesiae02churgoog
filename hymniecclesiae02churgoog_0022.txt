the blessed inhabitants of heaven. Next may be mentioned
the Gloria Patri, pretty much as we now use it. Thirdly, the‘
Trisagion, or ‘⁴ Holy, Holy‚ Holy,” from Isaiah vi.; or, as it
was also used, and now is, in the Roman Church, “ Sanctus
Deus, Sanctus Fortis, Sanctus Immortalis.” Besides these,

nor are two others of a later date, which we still retain, the
Te Deum and the Athanasium C'reed. They are both of Gal-
